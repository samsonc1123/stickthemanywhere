# Stick Them Anywhere - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

**Stick Them Anywhere** is an e-commerce website focused on sticker sales in general, with a unique capability to cater to customers who want to purchase just a single sticker - addressing the market gap where consumers can buy everything online but struggle to find retailers willing to sell individual stickers when needed.

The platform features a responsive, dark-themed interface with neon accents that adapts to different devices (iPhone vertical/horizontal, iPad, Android). Users navigate through a hierarchical category system using horizontally-scrolling aqua buttons that lead to subcategory pages. Product discovery happens through vertically-scrolling picture boxes that display stickers, with the layout adjusting based on device orientation (1 column vertical, 2 columns horizontal on phones).

Key features include full-screen product preview, comprehensive customization capabilities, shopping cart functionality, custom sizing via pinch gestures on tablets, and custom design upload capabilities. The UI incorporates smooth animations, contextual scroll bars, and a distinctive neon color scheme (white/pink/aqua/yellow) against a black perforated background.

The website aims to become the destination for sticker enthusiasts, offering both curated collections across multiple categories and custom sticker creation services through an intuitive, mobile-first user experience, powered by same-day fulfillment capabilities.

## Problem Statement

**Current Market Gap:** Consumers who want to purchase individual stickers face significant barriers in the current market. While virtually every other product category is readily available for online purchase, stickers are typically sold in bulk packs, sheets, or collections, forcing customers to buy more than they need or want.

**User Pain Points:**

- Existing sticker retailers focus primarily on bulk sales and sheets, making it difficult for customers who want just a single sticker
- Limited platforms offer comprehensive sticker browsing with the flexibility to purchase any quantity - from individual pieces to bulk orders
- Poor mobile shopping experience for sticker browsing, especially when trying to visualize actual size and quality
- Lack of customization options for sizing, materials, or personal designs across different purchase quantities
- No single destination serves both casual buyers wanting one sticker and serious enthusiasts needing bulk quantities
- Limited expansion into related products like posters, logos, and decals within a unified shopping experience

**Market Opportunity:** The sticker market continues to grow with applications in personal expression, crafting, decorating, and collecting, but lacks a specialized e-commerce solution focused on individual sticker sales with a premium user experience.
